      "The work traces an ambiguous boundary between flesh and function, asking what it means to sense through a circuit. Technology becomes less a tool and more a prosthetic of thought.",
      "Interfaces are not just touchpoints but thresholds of becoming. The artwork lingers in the speculative, imagining futures where cognition leaks beyond the skull.",
      "Within its system, intention blurs into entropy. Control is never total, and randomness never pure—each informing the other in quiet negotiation.",
      "Here, computation is not utility but ambience. The algorithm breathes, pulses, hesitates. Meaning is dispersed in the haze of automated gestures and emergent form.",
      "A hybrid ecology unfolds, where tactile encounters trigger machinic reverberations. The biological and the digital intertwine, neither dominating the other.",
      "The work makes the imperceptible felt, if only faintly. It gestures at structures—networked, coded, institutional—that surround without announcing themselves.",
      "Nothing arrives unscathed. As data moves through layers, each translation alters its essence. The artwork dwells in this friction.",
      "Viewer and system co-produce the experience in real time. Perception becomes stimulus, response becomes structure.",
      "Code is enacted like choreography—ritualistic, procedural, inscrutable. The material substrate flickers with ghost logic.",
      "Agency disperses across circuits, screens, and eyes. The artwork refuses singular authorship, instead positioning itself as a node in a wider mesh."
